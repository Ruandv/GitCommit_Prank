# GitCommit_Prank

## Overview
This project uses a Git `post-commit` hook managed by Husky. The `post-commit` hook is a script that runs automatically after every successful commit in this repository.

## How it works
- The `post-commit` hook is located in the `.husky/post-commit` file.
- Whenever you make a commit, this script will be triggered automatically.
- You can customize the script to perform any actions you want after a commit (e.g., display a message, run tests, etc.).

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install Husky and set up the hooks.
3. The `post-commit` hook will now run after every commit.

## Customization
Edit the `.husky/post-commit` file to change what happens after each commit.
